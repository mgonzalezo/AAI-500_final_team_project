# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Dataset - Data Cleaning Pipeline

This README walks through the data cleaning steps performed on the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle. The goal is to prepare the dataset for machine learning tasks by addressing missing values, correcting datatypes, and handling outliers or inconsistencies.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains demographic and health-related information of patients, with the target column `stroke` indicating whether a patient had a stroke.

### Features
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `gender`: "Male", "Female", or "Other"
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `hypertension`: 0 if no hypertension, 1 if yes
- `heart_disease`: 0 if no heart disease, 1 if yes
- `ever_married`: "Yes" or "No"
- `work_type`: Type of work ("Private", "Self-employed", etc.)
- `Residence_type`: "Urban" or "Rural"
- `avg_glucose_level`: Average glucose level in blood
- `bmi`: Body mass index
- `smoking_status`: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes", or "Unknown"
- `stroke`: 0 or 1 (target variable)
