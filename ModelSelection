Logistic Regression
Why Logistic Regression?
1.Binary Outcome: Your target variable stroke is binary (0 = no stroke, 1 = stroke), which is the classic scenario for logistic regression.

2.Explanatory Variables: The dataset includes both categorical (e.g., gender, work_type, smoking_status) and continuous (e.g., age, avg_glucose_level, bmi) predictors. Logistic regression handles both well using appropriate coding (e.g., dummy variables).

3.Interpretability: Logistic regression provides interpretable coefficients (odds ratios), which is especially important in medical applications like stroke prediction.

4.Statistical Foundation: As the book shows, logistic regression belongs to the family of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), and is the canonical model for binary response variables.

5.Robustness: It does not assume normality of predictors, unlike linear discriminant analysis


While logistic regression is a strong starting point, it's important to be aware of certain challenges:

Class Imbalance: The dataset has significantly more instances of non-stroke cases than stroke cases. This imbalance can affect model performance. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be used to address this issue.

Model Performance: Studies have shown that while logistic regression performs well, more complex models like Random Forests or ensemble methods can achieve higher accuracy. For instance, a study reported that Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 96% in stroke prediction


Logistic regression allows you to build a strong understanding of model building and evaluation. As you become more comfortable, you can explore more complex models:

Random Forests: These can capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables.

Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM): These often provide high accuracy and are widely used in machine learning competitions.

Neural Networks: These can model complex patterns but require more data and computational resources.
